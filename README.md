# Lite-qrcode-detector-on-Nao
This is part of my Bachelor's graduation project, which intends to enable Nao Robots to detect QRcodes and extract orders from them. Thus Nao Robots could accomplish basic tasks automatically, without men's direct instructions. 
Many repetitive and tedious works have been done by robots in big companies(Amazon, Sina, etc) instead of manual human effort. I am trying to explore how robots can manage basic operaions in a self-learning way, or in a info-seeking way, to be precise.
